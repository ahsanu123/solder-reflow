## Description

This library allows you to quickly setup a State Machine. Read here [what a state machine is](https://majenko.co.uk/blog/our-blog-1/the-finite-state-machine-26) and [why a state machine is neat for hardware projects](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/state-machines-event-driven-systems?utm_source=pocket_mylist).

It has been tested with Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP32 devices.

## How To Use

* You first need to define a set of states for your state machine
* Then, define transitions (regular or timed) for these state
* Pass the transitions to your state machine
* Define an initial state
* ...and add the `run()` function in your loop
* See [SimpleTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino) for a basic example

### Defining States

* A finite state machine has a defined set of states
* A state must have a name...
* ...and can have callback functions for different events (when a state is entered, exited, or stays in a state)

```c++
  State(
    String name, 
    CallbackFunction on_enter, 
    CallbackFunction on_state = NULL, 
    CallbackFunction on_exit = NULL, 
    bool is_final = false
  );
```

* Most states will have the entry handler
* The easiest way to define states is creating using an array, e.g. as shown in [MixedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino):
  
  ```c++
  State s[] = {
    State("red",        on_red),
    State("green",      on_green),
    State("BTN",        on_button_press)
  };
  ```

* The inital state **must** of the state machine must be defined – either via the constructor or the `setup()` function or via the `setInitialState()` function
* None, one, or multiple states can be defined as an end state via `setAsFinal()`
* For the full `State` class definition see [State.h](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/State.h)

### Transitions

* This library offers two types of Transitions, regular and timed ones
* All transitions must have a from and and a to state
* Transitions can have a callback function for when the transition is executed, a name, and a [guard condition](#guard-conditions)
* You can add both types to a state machine, see [MixedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino) for an example
* See [Transitions.h](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/src/Transitions.h) for the class definitions of `Transition` and `TimedTransition`.
* Note: Both classes are based of an abstract class which is not to be used in your code.

### Regular Transitions

```c++
  Transition(
    State* from, 
    State* to, 
    int event_id, 
    CallbackFunction on_run = NULL, 
    String name = "", 
    GuardCondition guard = NULL
  );
```

* Regular transitions must have a a set of states and a trigger (ID):

  ```c++
  Transition transitions[] = {
    Transition(&s[0], &s[1], light_switch_flipped),
    Transition(&s[1], &s[0], light_switch_flipped)
  };
  ```

* Define the triggers for your state machine in an enum (and set the first enum value to 1, to be safe):

  ```c++
  enum triggers {
    light_switch_flipped = 1  
  };
  ```

* To call a trigger use the `trigger()`function:

  ```c++
  fsm.trigger(light_switch_flipped);
  ```

* See [SimpleTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/SimpleTransitions/SimpleTransitions.ino) and [SimpleTransitionWithButtons.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/SimpleTransitionWithButton/SimpleTransitionWithButton.ino) for more details

### Timed Transitions

```c++
  TimedTransition(
    State* from, 
    State* to, 
    int interval, 
    CallbackFunction on_run = NULL, 
    String name = "", 
    GuardCondition guard = NULL
  );
```

* Timed transitions are automatically executed after a certain amount of time has passed
* The interval is defined in milliseconds:

  ```c++
  TimedTransition timedTransitions[] = {
    TimedTransition(&s[0], &s[1], 6000),
    TimedTransition(&s[1], &s[0], 4000),
    TimedTransition(&s[2], &s[1], 2000)
  };
  ```

* See [TimedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/TimedTransitions/TimedTransitions.ino) for more details

### Guard Conditions

* Guard conditions are evaluated before a transition takes places
* Only if the guard condition is true the transition will be executed
* Both regular and timed transitions can have guard conditions
* You define guard conditions as functions:

  ```c++
  TimedTransition timedTransitions[] = {
    TimedTransition(&s[0], &s[1], 1000, NULL, "", zero_yet),
    TimedTransition(&s[0], &s[0], 1000, NULL, "", not_zero_yet)
  };  

  bool not_zero_yet() {
    return countdown != 0;
  }

  bool zero_yet() {
    return countdown == 0;
  }
  ```

* See [Guards.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/Guards/Guards.ino) for a complete example

### In-State Interval

* States can have up to three events...
  * when they enter a state
  * while they are in a state
  * ...and when they leave the state

```c++
  State(String name, CallbackFunction on_enter, CallbackFunction on_state = NULL, CallbackFunction on_exit = NULL, bool is_final = false);
```

* To define how frequent the `on_state` event is called, pass an interval (in ms) to the `run()` function in your main `loop()`:

  ```c++
  void run(int interval = 1000, CallbackFunction tick_cb = NULL);
  ```

* After this interval has passed the `on_state` function of the active state will be called (if it defined)
* Also the `tick_cb`callback function will be called (if defined) in the `run()` call

### Helper functions

* SimpleFSM provides a few functions to check on the state of the machine:

  ```c++
    State* getState() const;
    State* getPreviousState() const;
    bool isInState(State* state) const;
    int lastTransitionedAt() const;
    bool isFinished() const;

  ```

### GraphViz Generation

* Use the function `getDotDefinition()` to get your state machine definition in the GraphViz [dot format](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)
* Here the output for the [MixedTransitions.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.ino) example:
  
  ```c++
    digraph G {
      rankdir=LR; pad=0.5
      node [shape=circle fixedsize=true width=1.5];
      "red light" -> "green light" [label=" (6000ms)"];
      "green light" -> "red light" [label=" (4000ms)"];
      "button pressed" -> "green light" [label=" (2000ms)"];
      "red light" -> "button pressed" [label=" (ID=1)"];
      "red light" [style=filled fontcolor=white fillcolor=black];
    }
  ```

* You can use this visualize your state machine:\
  ![MixedTransitions.ino example](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitions/MixedTransitions.svg?raw=true)

* If the machine is running, the current state will be highlighted
* Currently guard functions and end states are not shown in the graph
* See [MixedTransitionsBrowser.ino](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/SimpleFSM/blob/master/examples/MixedTransitionsBrowser/MixedTransitionsBrowser.ino) to learn how to run a webserver to show the Graphviz diagram of your state machine

## Notes

* This libary is heavily inspiried by the [Arduino-fsm](https://github.com/jonblack/arduino-fsm) library created by [Jon Black](https://github.com/jonblack). I initally used some of his as a base. Without Jon's work this library would not exist.
